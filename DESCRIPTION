Title: Copula-Based Regression Models for Bivariate Censored Data
Version: 1.1.2
Author: Tao Sun, Ying Ding
Maintainer: Tao Sun <tao.sun@pitt.edu>
Description: Copula-based regression models for bivariate censored data, including 
 bivariate right-censored data and bivariate interval-censored data. Currently 
 supports Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Joe, AMH and Copula2 copula models. For 
 marginal models, it supports parametric (Weibull, Loglogistic, Gompertz) and
 semiparametric (Cox and transformation) models. Includes methods for convenient
 prediction and plotting. Also provides a bivariate time-to-event simulation function.
