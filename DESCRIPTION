Title: Copula-Based Regression Models for Multivariate Censored Data
Version: 1.2.2
Author: Tao Sun, Ying Ding
Maintainer: Tao Sun <sun.tao@ruc.edu.cn>
Description: Copula-based regression models for multivariate censored data, including 
 bivariate right-censored data, bivariate interval-censored data, and interval-censored 
 semi-competing risks data. Currently supports Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Joe, AMH and 
 Copula2 copula models. For marginal models, it supports parametric (Weibull, Loglogistic, 
 Gompertz) and semiparametric (Cox and transformation) models. Includes methods for 
 convenient prediction and plotting. Also provides a bivariate time-to-event simulation 
 function and an information ratio-based goodness-of-fit test for copula. Method details 
 can be found in Sun et.al (2019) Lifetime Data Analysis, Sun et.al (2021) Biostatistics, 
 Sun et.al (2022) Statistical Methods in Medical Research, and Sun et.al (2022) Biometrics.
